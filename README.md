# ML-Weather-Prediction-New-Delhi 
**Machine Learning Project on Weather Prediction for New Delhi**  
###  Data Collection & Cleaning:
 Collected weather data from NOAA and cleaned it using Python (**Pandas, NumPy**). Managed missing data and prepared it for analysis.
###  Data Visualization:
Created visual charts using **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** to understand weather patterns.
###  Model Building & Testing:
Built and tested **ridge regression model**, achieving a prediction accuracy with a mean absolute error of 2.25°F. Improved the model’s accuracy by using rolling averages and exponential means.
